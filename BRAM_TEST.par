INFO:Par:402 - SmartGuide was run during Map. Since all guiding (mapping, packing, placement and routing) is completed in MAP, PAR does not
   require the use of the guide switches. The -smartguide switch only generates a post place and route guide report in the SmartGuide Report
   File(.GRF). Runtime can be reduced, if this detailed report is not generated. PAR will automatically generate the SmartGuide summary
   report based on the guide file used during MAP. This summary information is always in the PAR report file and the GRF.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
