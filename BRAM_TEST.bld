Checking expanded design ...
WARNING:NgdBuild:604 - logical block 'c' with type 'cache' could not be
   resolved. A pin name misspelling can cause this, a missing edif or ngc file,
   case mismatch between the block name and the edif or ngc file name, or the
   misspelling of a type name. Symbol 'cache' is not supported in target
   'spartan6'.
